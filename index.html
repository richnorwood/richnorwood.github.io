			<h3> The 1st rule of the deposit club is </h3>
			
			<div>
				<p> you don't talk about the deposit club - well at least whilst we're operating in stealth mode. </p>
				<p> But when we launch we want you to tell the world. </p>
				<p> However as you're here, you must have alrady spoken to us, or spoken to someone who has spoken to us, or spoken to someone who spoke to someone who spoke to us, or....ok you get the idea. </p>
				<p> We are about to launch our pilot programme, and help our first bunch of fine upstanding citizens get on to the property ladder.
